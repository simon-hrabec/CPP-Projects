# CPP-Projects
Mix of random C++ things I created.
## Algorithms, data structures and other CP stuff

 - [Union-Find (DSU)](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/CPP-Projects/tree/master/union-find) - Typical `O(log*(n))` implementation
 - [Big Integer](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/CPP-Projects/tree/master/big-integer) - unlimited size integer implementation (supporting +, *, and exponentiation)
## Fun work, coding exercises
- [Compact Linked List](https://github.com/simon-hrabec/CPP-Projects/tree/master/compact-linked-list) - Bit packed value- and size-capped singly linked list with `O(1)` operations.
