# Shared Pointer
If I need to have shared ownership in my C++ code, I can use a shared pointer. C++11 introduced `std::shared_ptr<T>` smart pointer, which is now part of the standard library. Therefore, there is no need to reimplement it (reinvent the wheel). Unless... you want to have some fun or see it as a learning experience and entertaining exercise. On this page I will show several iterations of shared pointer implementation from the most basic one to (ideally/eventually) a full version that supports all the features like the standard one. I intend to have this page also as a learning resource. 

## Versions
Building complexity one layer at a time.

### Version 1 - Barebone shared pointer
This version is the absolute minimal one. It has a constructor that allocates the control block with a reference counter. Since the shared pointer can be used by multiple threads at the same time, to avoid race conditions, the counter needs to be an atomic variable. Contrary to the constructor, the destructor decrements the counter and if it is the last one, it deallocates the owned object. The shared pointer can be copied via the copy constructor.

### Version 2 - Additional methods and `make_shared_pointer`
This version adds the option to have an empty shared pointer (using the `reset` method). It adds several other methods (`swap`, `operator bool`, `use_count`, empty constructor) and adds the function `make_shared_pointer` (mirroring `make_shared`), which can accept parameters for a constructor of `T` and handle the object construction (via parameter forwarding). Note that this function should normally allocate the object and control block together (to save 1 allocation and improve space locality), but this version does not do it - it will be addressed in future versions. However, the interface of the method will not change.

### Version 3 - Assignment operator, move assignment, move constructor
The assignment operator is always a bit more complicated than a copy constructor because we need to deal with the already existing object and the possibility of self-assignment. Moreover, a shared pointer can be empty. C++11 also introduced move semantics, hence we should cover them as well. All of those are just a bunch of ifs, checking the state properly, reassigning the data/block pointer, possibly decreasing the counter, and deallocating the block if necessary.

### Version 4 - `make_shared_pointer` with a single allocation
When creating the shared pointer with the `make_shared_pointer` helper function, instead of having two separate allocations - one for the control block and one for the object - we want to have only 1 such call and allocate both simultaneously. We therefore need to create another version of the control block that, besides the reference counter, will also contain the object itself. However, both shared pointers (one created with an object pointer and the second created with the `make_shared_pointer` function) are of the same type and are interoperable. To allow for such flexibility, we create 2 specializations of the block class and let them do the deallocations in their (virtual) destructor. We then have the `make_shared_pointer` to forward the arguments to the constructor of the `control_block_with_object`, which then creates the object.

### Version 5 - Aliasing constructor and `get`
The standard shared pointer also has an "aliasing constructor". It allows to make a distinction between what the pointer is pointing to and the managed data. You can have a managed `struct` and the pointer pointing only to its member variable. This is fairly easy to achieve with another constructor. However, a problem occurs because now we need to mix together different instantiations of `shared_poointer`. So far the control block could be a nested class (to hide it as an implementation detail), but now we have an issue, because `shared_pointer<T1>::control_block` and `shared_pointer<T2>::control_block` are two different (and hence incompatible types). Therefore it is must be declared as a standalone class (see [SO](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77342783/nested-class-of-a-template-class-interoperability-and-visibility/77343089#77343089)).

Finally, the `get()` method is the same as the `operator->`.

### Version 6 - Comparisons, `std::hash`
C++20 simplified the process of implementing all the comparison operators (`<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `==`, `!=`) due to the introduction of the "spaceship" operator `<=>`. However, before implementing that, we need to decide in the first place what the operation should do. More or less I could think of 3 options:

 1. Allow comparisons between any shared pointer, comparing the values
 2. Allow comparisons of the same shared pointer type, comparing the values
 3. Allow comparisons of the same shared pointer type, comparing the pointer values

Even though options 1 and 2 sound convenient, the `std::shared_ptr` uses the third option. One of the reasons is to allow the use of shared pointers in other data structures like `std::map` and `std::set`. Nevertheless, if you wanted to implement option 1, the code could look like this:

    template<std::three_way_comparable_with<T> U>
    std::compare_three_way_result_t<T, U> operator<=>(const shared_pointer<U>& other) const noexcept {
        if (has_value() && other.has_value()) {
            return *data <=> *other.data;
        }
        return (has_value()) <=> (other.has_value());
    }

To use the pointer comparison, the code is simpler:

    std::strong_ordering operator<=>(const shared_pointer& other) const noexcept {
        return data <=> other.data;
    }

However, we still need to implement the `operator==` and also overloads for `std::nullptr_t`. We can have the `operator==` generated, but only if we use the `= default` for the spaceship operator.

Now we can use `shared_pointer` in `std::set`, but for `std::unordered_set` we need to implement (specialize) the `std::hash` function. This is simple, we just return the call of the hash function on the pointer.

### Version 7 - Custom deleter
Both `std::shared_ptr`  and `std::unique_ptr` have the option to create the owned resource also with a custom deleter - a user-provided code that will execute at the end of the lifetime of the object instead of the default `delete data;`. However, the difference between those two smart pointers is that the custom deleter of `std::unique_ptr` is part of the type, whereas for `std::shared_ptr` the type is erased (the deleter is part of the control block). All we need is to add additional operator overload that will accept the deleter - a functor. Something that allows for a call to the `operator()`. A default deleter can therefore look something like this:

    template <typename T>
    struct default_deleter {
        void operator()(T const* data_pointer) {
            delete data_pointer;
        }
    };
